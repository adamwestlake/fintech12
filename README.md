### Project Aim
Create an optimal machine learning model to buy and sell cryptocurrencies within the top ___ in market cap. This will be done by first analysing multiple machine learning models, then presenting the best one(s) to the consumer, through a user-friendly interface. The interface will allow currency and asset conversion, display market sentiment, and display the outcome of the optimum model.  

### Applying ML in the context of technologies learned:
Utilizing ML and classifiers the objective is to provide analysis of the actual historical returns data against multiple strategy returns with visualization aswell as informing the customer of the perceived confidence (accuracy) with which each ML classifier completed its final analysis.
